<p class="biography">
                <span>P</span>aul Cézanne, (born January 19, 1839, Aix-en-Provence, France—died October 22, 1906, Aix-en-Provence), French painter, one of the greatest of the Post-Impressionists, whose works and ideas were influential in the aesthetic development of many 20th-century artists and art movements, especially Cubism. Cézanne’s art, misunderstood and discredited by the public during most of his life, grew out of Impressionism and eventually challenged all the conventional values of painting in the 19th century because of his insistence on personal expression and on the integrity of the painting itself, regardless of subject matter. See also the Britannica Classic by Roger Fry: Cézanne.

Early life and work
Cézanne was the son of a well-to-do bourgeois family. 
He received a classical education at the Collège Bourbon in Aix. 
In 1858, under the direction of his father—a successful banker 
determined to have his son enter the same profession—Cézanne
 entered the law school of the University of Aix-en-Provence.
  He had no taste for the law, however, having decided at an early 
  age to pursue some kind of artistic career, and after two years 
  he persuaded his father, with the support of his mother’s entreaties, 
  to allow him to study painting in Paris.

Cézanne’s first stay in Paris lasted only five months. The instability 
of his personality gave way to severe depression almost immediately when 
he found that he was not as proficient technically as some of the students 
at the Académie Suisse, the studio where he began his instruction. 
He stayed as long as he did only because of the encouragement of the 
writer Émile Zola, with whom he had formed a close friendship at the 
Collège Bourbon. Returning to Aix, Cézanne made a new attempt to content 
himself with working at his father’s bank, but after a year he returned 
to Paris with strengthened resolution to stay. During his formative period, 
from about 1858 to 1872, Cézanne alternated between living in Paris and visiting Aix.

The early 1860s was a period of great vitality for Parisian literary and 
artistic activity. The conflict had reached its height between the Realist 
painters, led by Gustave Courbet, and the official Académie des Beaux-Arts, 
which rejected from its annual exhibition—and thus from public acceptance—all
 paintings not in the academic Neoclassical or Romantic styles. In 1863 the 
 emperor Napoleon III decreed the opening of a Salon des Refusés to counter 
 the growing agitation in artistic circles over painters refused by the Salon 
 of the Académie. The works of the Refusés were almost universally denounced by 
 critics—a reaction that consolidated the revolutionary spirit of these painters. Cézanne, whose tastes had soon shifted away from the academic, became associated with the most advanced members of this group, including Édouard Manet, Camille Pissarro, Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Edgar Degas. Most of these artists were only in their 20s (as was Cézanne) and were just forming their styles; they were to become, with the exception of Manet, the Impressionist school. Cézanne’s friend Zola was passionately devoted to their cause, but Cézanne’s friendship with the other artists was at first inhibited by his touchiness and deliberate rudeness, born of extreme shyness and a moodiness that was offended by their convivial ways. Nevertheless, he was inspired by their revolutionary spirit as he sought to synthesize the influences of Courbet, who pioneered the unsentimental treatment of commonplace subjects, and of the Romantic painter Eugène Delacroix, whose compositions, emphasizing colour instead of line, greatly impressed Cézanne.
